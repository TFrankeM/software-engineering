<h4> Final report A1: </h4>
<p>
    In this <a href="Simulação_de_Sprint_Scrum.pdf">report</a>, we present the decisions made by our team 
    regarding the system's architecture and the application of Extreme Programming (XP) practices as part of the Software Engineering course. This 
    work was conducted during a simulated Scrum sprint, where we prioritized key architectural attributes such as security, stability, and ease of 
    use. Our goal was to align these decisions with the project’s requirements and the specific dynamics of our team. Additionally, we discuss the 
    adoption of XP practices, like Test-Driven Development (TDD) and continuous refactoring, while balancing these with the demands of the project 
    and the team’s unique challenges.

<h4> Instructions for running the Vending Machine System: </h4>

<p>
  To run the Vending Machine System, follow these steps.
</p>

<h5>Clone the Repository</h5> 
<p>
  First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
</p>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TFrankeM/software-engineering.git
```

<h5>Install Dependencies</h5> 
<p>
  Navigate to the root of the project directory and install the necessary dependencies. You can use pip to install the required Python packages:
</p>

```bash
pip install pandas bcrypt time sys os sqlite3 datetime uuid unittest
```

<h5>Navigate to the Main File</h5> 
<p>
  Navigate to the directory where the main.py file is located. It's inside the src folder:
</p>

```bash
cd src
```

<h5>Run the Application</h5> 
<p>
  Once you're inside the src folder, you can run the main.py file to start the Vending Machine System:
</p>

```bash
python main.py
```

<h5>Interact with the System</h5> 
<p>
  Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the vending machine system as a seller or a customer. You will be able to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>View and manage vending machines and their inventory</li>
  <li>Report issues with machines or the system</li>
  <li>Make or view reviews of vending machines or products</li>
</ul>

<h4> Stakeholder interview report: </h4>

<p>
  This repository hosts the detailed <a href = "https://tfrankem.github.io/software-engineering/main%20page/index.html">report<a/> on our stakeholder interview activities, carried out 
  within the scope of the study and application of requirements engineering techniques. We plan to 
  include in the   future code snippets of the application addressed during requirements elicitation, 
  which will provide valuable contributions to the study of software engineering.

<h4> Reflection on practical aircraft production class: </h4>

<p>
  In addition, we incorporated a <a href = "Reflexão_aviões_de_papel.pdf">reflexive analysis<a/> on the production chain dynamics, carried out on 
  September 3, 2024, to enrich our understanding of the process.
